# autotinder_MLH

**Experimental project put aside without completion**


Started during the MLH hackathon in Leuven (2016), this uses Clarifai API to process new Tinder profile images to automatically select for
a left or right swipe. Previously, data sets are provided in the form of images for the Clariai AI to make a decision.
